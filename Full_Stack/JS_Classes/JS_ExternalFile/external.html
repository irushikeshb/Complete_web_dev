        <h3> Advantages of External JavaScript</h3>
        There will be following benefits if a user creates an external javascript: <br>
        <br>
        1. It helps in the reusability of code in more than one HTML file. <br>
        2. It allows easy code readability. <br>
        3. It is time-efficient as web browsers cache the external js files, which further reduces the page loading time. <br>
        4. It enables both web designers and coders to work with html and js files parallelly and separately, i.e., without facing any code conflictions. <br>
        5. The length of the code reduces as only we need to specify the location of the js file. <br>

       <h3> Disadvantages of External JavaScript</h3>
        There are the following disadvantages of external files: <br>

        1. The stealer may download the coder's code using the url of the js file. <br>
        2. If two js files are dependent on one another, then a failure in one file may affect the execution of the other dependent file. <br>
        3. The web browser needs to make an additional http request to get the js code. <br>
        4. A tiny to a large change in the js code may cause unexpected results in all its dependent files. <br>
        5. We need to check each file that depends on the commonly created external javascript file. <br>
        6. If it is a few lines of code, then better to implement the internal javascript code.
