    <h1>What is COVID-19?</h1>

    <p>The new COVID-19 is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. The most likely ecological reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2 are bats,
        but it is believed that the virus jumped the species barrier to humans from another intermediate animal host. This
        intermediate animal host could be a domestic food animal, a wild animal, or a domesticated wild animal which has
        not yet been identified.
        WHO continues to collaborate with experts, Member States and other partners to identify gaps and research priorities
        for the control of COVID-19, and provide advice to countries and individuals on prevention measures. National food
        safety authorities have been following this event with the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN)
        Secretariat to seek more information on the potential for persistence of the virus on foods traded internationally and
        the potential role of food in the transmission of the virusCOVID-19 is the disease caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.  
    WHO first learned of this new virus on 31 December 2019, following a report of a cluster of cases of ‘viral pneumonia’ in Wuhan, People’s Republic of China.</p>

    <h1>What happens to people who get COVID-19?</h1>

    <p>Among those who develop symptoms, most (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment.
         About 15% become seriously ill and require oxygen and 5% become critically ill and need intensive care.
         Although for most people COVID-19 causes only mild illness, it can make some people very ill. More rarely, the disease can be fatal.
          Older people, and those with pre- existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes) appear to be more vulnerable</p>
